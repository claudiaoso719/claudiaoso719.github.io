                <h3>Who I Am</h3>
                <p>Hi! I'm Claudia, a second year Computer Science graduate student passionate about tools engineering, pipelines, and game engine development. Currently pursuing my MS at USC and serving as Usability Lead on a game project this academic year.</p>
                
                <p>I'm passionate about retro technology (exhibit A: this website), video games, music, and making things. I love the idea of building developer tools and systems that understand how people work. When I'm not coding, you can find me watching YouTube videos about abandoned places, sewing my own clothes, or hunting for vintage tech.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="post">
                <h3>How I Got Here</h3>
                <p>I've found my way to tools programming through different experiences. I did my undergrad at Carnegie Mellon studying Information Systems with minors in Intelligent Environments and Sonic Arts so I've always been interested in how people and technology interact.</p>
                
                <p>After graduating I worked at Twitter as a Software Engineer, building platform tools that supported thousands of engineers. There's something really exciting and fulfilling about building systems that make other people's work easier.</p>
                
                <p>But I realized I wanted to pivot towards creative tools and focusing on helping artists. Now I'm at USC focusing on game engines, graphics, and tools development. Additionally, I have spent the past two summers working with Adobe Research on innovative creative tools. This combination of art and technology feels like the perfect fit for who I am.</p>

                <h3>What I Love</h3>
                <p>I have way too many CDs (370+ and counting), a collection of digital cameras, and very strong opinions about early 2000s web design. I'm really into video games, music, movies, and making things with my hands -- whether that's coding or sewing my own clothes.</p>
                
                <p>I feel like the internet used to be more weird, innovative, and authentic so I'm adamant about bringing that vibe back in my own way (as you can tell by this website).</p>
            </div> -->

            <div class="post">
                <h3>Why Tools & Pipelines</h3>
                <p>I want to learn how to build tools that people actually enjoy using. Tools that make creative work feel more creative, not more tedious. Working in research has allowed me to think about the usability of tools and how to best fit the needs of our users.</p>

                <h3>What's Next</h3>
                <p>Right now I'm learning Houdini for procedural generation and VFX workflows, and exploring how to build tools and pipelines that improve creative workflows. I'd love to work at a game, VFX, or animation studio building tools that empower artists and developers.</p>
