                <p>Built a computer vision system that automatically solves jigsaw puzzles by extracting piece contours, matching edges using Mean Squared Error analysis, and assembling solutions through greedy graph traversal. Implemented rotation handling with perspective transformation and edge blur correction for rotated pieces.</p>
                <p><strong>Key Features:</strong> Contour detection and piece extraction, MSE-based edge matching with relaxed matching algorithm, greedy BFS assembly with rotation support, animated solution visualization</p>
                <p><strong>Impact:</strong> Successfully solved puzzles with both uniform translation and rotation, achieving sub-second assembly times</p>

                <p>Built a network file streaming service with HTTP server and intelligent caching system for game asset loading. The demo shows side-by-side spawning of car meshes - the right car loads locally while the left car streams from the network server. Real-time performance metrics display load times, demonstrating the caching system's impact: first network load takes ~0.13 seconds, subsequent cached loads complete nearly instantly (~0.01 seconds). The demo shows cache clearing and toggling to illustrate performance differences with and without caching enabled.</p>
                <p><strong>Key Features:</strong> HTTP-based asset server, client-side caching with runtime toggle and cache clearing, real-time performance metrics display, visual differentiation between local and network-loaded assets</p>
                <p><strong>Impact:</strong> Demonstrated understanding of asset pipeline optimization and network-based content delivery for game development</p>
                <p><strong>Technologies:</strong> C++, Python HTTP Server, Caching Systems, Lua API Integration, PrimeEngine</p>

                <p>Built as part of my game engine coursework, this real-time script hot reloading pipeline enables developers to see code changes instantly without application restarts. The demo shows a soldier tracking and shooting at a moving target controlled by Lua script. Mid-gameplay, I modify the script to stop the target's movement and reload it - the soldier continues tracking but the target immediately stops, demonstrating live script updates without restarting the game.</p>
                <p><strong>Key Features:</strong> Script Registry with file monitoring, rolling hash-based change detection, seamless runtime script execution via Lua C API</p>
                <p><strong>Impact:</strong> Eliminated need for application restarts during development, enabling rapid iteration on game logic and behavior</p>
